The workflow designer communicates with your Moqui instance using REST APIs.
The base API URL path is configured in the `.env` file.
All API requests are pass though a proxy to reach the Moqui instance, this is configured in the `vue.config.js` file.

```javascript
module.exports = {
    // ...
    proxy: {
        // proxy all requests starting with /rest/s1 to localhost:8081
        '/rest/s1': {
            target: 'http://localhost:8081',
            ws: true,
            changeOrigin: true
        }
    }
    // ...
}
```

See the [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/) for a detailed description of all available configuration options.
